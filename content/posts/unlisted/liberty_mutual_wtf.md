On 2024-March-15th, I created a request with Subaru to delete personal data, from Subaru and from its partners.

Timeline:

- 2024-March-15th - Original request
- 2024-Aug-2nd
  - 10:55 AM: Automated response from Privacy@libertymutual.com, claims "Once that is completed, we will review your request and respond within 45 days"
  - I do that...
  - 4:05 PM: "Two more steps are required"
  - I do that...
  - 4:07 PM: "Please Visit LM to Validate Your Identity", no link included
  - 4:25 PM, I email them.
  - 4:53 PM, I call Michelle who tells me to email them.
    - `privacy@libertymutual.com` -- Michelle at LibertyMutual, told me: Let them know I have filled out the requested form, but the email I received lacked the link.
