Right now, I'm:

 - Creating art and collaborating for version 2 of Apocalypse Sirens, an open-source trading card game
 - [Making it easier to opt out of arbitration clauses](https://github.com/lynnpepin/arbitration-opt-out-templates/)
 - Learning music theory and composition `:)`
 - Getting back into my favorite hobby, gamedev
