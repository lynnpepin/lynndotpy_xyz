Animal Crossing started out as a top-down third-person game. Starting with the DS entry 'Wild World', Animal Crossing started using a vertex transform [dubbed the 'rolling log' effect](https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/20/e3-2005-animal-crossing-ds-interview). This effectively combined the top-down view with a view of the horizon and sky. This "extended" how much of the map was visible, while also keeping the stars, constellations, moon, and floating presents within view.

Vertex transforms were also briefly popular in MineCraft, albeit mainly for trippy warps for YouTube views.

I think vertex transforms like these offer a lot of potential.

Imagine a Halo game taking place along an entire ring. The open world map would be integrated into the environment in the form of the ring itself.

No Man's Sky does something like this, implementing a world as a cube and mapping it a sphere when landing.
