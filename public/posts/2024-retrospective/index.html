            <p>Whew, 2024 was quite a year. This was a year where I had a surplus of free time. I twiddled away on Blender projects, I picked up photography and guitar, I made a new friend, and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> released, which was maybe the highlight of my year.</p>
<p>But this is a <em>devblog</em>, so, much as I'd love to, this won't be a <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> blogpost.</p>
<p>In my day job, I'm still just doing fullstack dev: Docker, Postgres, C#/.NET, TypeScript, Angular, some Python, and a teensy bit of Go and Rust. It's all proprietary, so I can't tell you more here. Womp womp.</p>
<p>But I got <em>a lot</em> done in 2024. </p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p><strong>In January</strong>, I finished up my late-2023 project, rewriting <strong>Reso in Rust</strong>, which I wrote about <a href="https://lynndotpy.dev/posts/reso-2023/">here</a>. <a href="https://resolang.dev/">It has a dinky website</a> made using <a href="https://opensource.axo.dev/oranda/">axo.dev's Oranda</a> and <a href="https://github.com/resolang/reso">a swanky GitHub org</a>! I can highly recommend <a href="https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/">axo.dev's <code>cargo-dist</code></a>, which makes GitHub releases very very easy. Reso now has <a href="https://crates.io/crates/reso">over 5000 downloads on crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>After Reso rust, I promptly started working on <a href="https://genuary.art/2024/"><strong>Genuary</strong></a>, a daily-procedural-art project. <a href="https://github.com/lynnpepin/genuary">You can see my work for Genuary2024 here</a>, mostly done in Rust using the excellent <a href="https://nannou.cc/">nannou</a> framework. This year, I'm doing Genuary2025, but making small <em>Bevy</em> games instead.</p>
<p><strong>In February</strong>, while catching up on Genuary, I also made a <em>tiny</em> contribution to Oranda, mentioned above, which felt <em>fantastic</em>. But I stopped work for a more important project, <strong>data analysis in support of New Haven's Rosette tiny-homes</strong>. I did data-work involving analysis and plotting of SeeClickFix data. We were happily surprised to see the homes granted zoning relief (i.e. approval) for six tiny-homes in New Haven, CT, which were providing shelter for otherwise unhoused people. You can read about the win <a href="https://www.newhavenindependent.org/article/unhoused_get_relief_from_zoning">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/rosette-street-prefab-shelters-new-haven-18958450.php">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>In March,</strong> I worked on and published <a href="https://lynndotpy.dev/posts/boycott-app-security/">this small security analysis</a> of three BDS boycott apps. I use boycat regularly despite its unnecessary and overly-broad terms, but Boycott for Peace is a close second. I <em>can not recommend &quot;NoThanks&quot;</em>, for its many embedded adware trackers. During this time, I also worked on an (unfinished) Halo fangame called &quot;RingBearer Zero&quot;. But I decided to shift my focus to learning Bevy instead. During this time, I also wrote a <a href="https://lynndotpy.dev/posts/mouse-wiggler-python/">a USB mouse wiggler</a> and I set up a <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin server</a> for my friends. I </p>
<p><strong>In April</strong>, I'd done a few small things. I trialed <a href="https://plasticity.xyz">plasticity.xyz</a>, having had used SolidWorks and Autodesk Inventor for CAD as a highschooler, and found it a formidable, cost-effective, and Linux-supported alternative. I raised awareness of and got <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/1cyh6d7/not_res_but_an_extension_popular_here_the_reddit/">MonsterMannen's once-good now-malware Reddit extension off the Chrome extension store</a> after seeing it request permissions for every webpage. I also <a href="https://github.com/lynnpepin/arbitration-opt-out-templates/">continued to update and accept PRs from my arbitration opt-out template repo</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In May,</strong> I mostly spent it on life errands, mostly wrapping up my PhD work and leaving with a masters, and working on small Godot projects.  I started <a href="https://github.com/lynnpepin/genericdefense2">a Godot Tower Defense project</a>. It's very very minimal. </p>
<p><strong>In June,</strong> I was also able to <strong>save a small-web community from disappearing!</strong> I saved a <a href="https://postmill.xyz/">postmill.xyz</a> instance, migrating it to a VPS and taking over as sysadmin after a failed Heroku migration killed the site. Having had been burned by dependency issues with PHP in the past (grrr Nextcloud!) I opted to learn and use <strong>Docker</strong> for this work. It required a lot of fiddling, database migration work, and bugfixing. I'm happy I was able to contribute back to Postmill, but I'm even prouder I was able to use my Linux skills and <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">save the day</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In July</strong>, I started work on <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">contributing to the Helix editor</a>, which I love. I wanted to add mouse support to support clicking on bufferline, and while I was unable to finish it, I compiled my notes and <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/4942">I'm excited to see <code>irh</code> has created a PR which adds this feature!</a> I also fixed the pagination on my personal blog, which I messed up in Zola.</p>
<p><strong>In August,</strong> I started working on a light mode for Bevy's website. You can <a href="https://github.com/lynnpepin/bevy-website">see my fork here</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/pull/1603">relevant PR / discussion here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/pull/1771"><code>doup</code>'s open PR here</a>. The dark-mode-only documentation made it difficult for me to learn Bevy in the daytime. I implemented a fork using <code>media: prefers-color-scheme</code>, but ultimately, the team wanted this to be implemented with a JavaScript toggle on top of that, so as to prefer the default dark. I wasn't able to hack that together in a timely manner, and other people took up the work. As of this writing, the light mode is still a WIP!</p>
<p>Oh, I also made <a href="https://github.com/lynnpepin/music_svgs">a few music SVGs for study.</a> I drew them by writing the SVGs in Helix :) And I got accepted onto <a href="https://lobste.rs">lobste.rs</a>, which was nice, as I was a long-time lurker.</p>
<p><strong>In September and October,</strong> I had some life disruptions. Meloncube had a failed migration which ruined the Minecraft server I run, and I promptly moved off of them. (Among other things, they removed the whitelist and broke backups, and griefers immediately took over.) I spent more time on Bevy light mode.</p>
<p><strong>In November,</strong> I started on a fork of the Obsidian plugin <a href="https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition/">spaced repetition</a>, i.e. flashcards, to add a feature I thought was missing: <em>Reshuffle</em>. When I use flashcards and I miss one, I like to reshuffle into the back of the deck, making sure I answer it correctly at least once. The plugin lacks this feature. This is still a work-in-progress, but would greatly improve the usefulness of the plugin for me.</p>
<p><strong>In December,</strong> I also started working on <a href="https://genuary.art">Genuary</a> for 2025, with the goal of getting a simple Bevy-to-wasm export set up. While Genuary is about  <a href="https://genuary2025.lynndotpy.dev/20241219/">You can see the fruit of that labor here!</a> As well as <a href="https://genuary2025.lynndotpy.dev/01/">the first day of genuary</a>.</p>
<p>I also got myself my first proper, mirrorless camera, a Sony Alpha a6400. I spent some quality time with that camera this month. :)</p>
