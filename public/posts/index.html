<p><strong>tldr</strong>: Your phone is online and going online is distracting. Instead of replacing your smartphone with many bulky purpose-built devices, consider using an old smartphone that you keep offline.</p>
<p>I do this and it works very very well for me, using an old iPhone 13 Mini running iOS 18. The battery lasts a long time in Airplane mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My relationship to technology as a consumer is atypical.</p>
<p>I did not own a cell phone until the age of 17, while my peers acquired theirs mostly in elementary and middle school. I did not own a proper smartphone until the age of 19. I don't have play games on my phone, I don't use and never have used &quot;short form video content&quot; apps like TikTok or Instagram Reels, and I don't have algorithmic feeds (besides the frontpages of Lobste.rs and Hacker News). I only get notifications for messages, and my phone stays on &quot;do not disturb&quot; at most times. I don't have a problem with &quot;smartphone addiction&quot;. I don't even like to listen to music in the background.</p>
<p>And yet, I have the same problem many others have: I also get distracted by my phone.</p>
<p>The reason is that I have an iPhone 16 Pro, and when I put myself to the two-handed task of heaving this towering behemoth and meeting its gaze long enough for the Facial Recognition to meander upon my features and grant me entry, I find myself inclined to complete other tasks: Checking emails, catching up on my Mastodon feed, responding to people, opening up an Internet Browser, or any other myriad minutia. </p>
<p>This giant internet-connected Apple phablet breaks ones piece of mind. Even without online features, how could it not? As of iOS 26, the UI is composed of elements glowing, throbbing, jiggling, wiggling, and refracting. This is called &quot;Liquid Glass&quot;.</p>
<p>But throughout a day, I might time my stretches, set a cooking timer, change my sleep alarm, turn on background noises, navigate with a map, or take a note. These can all be accomplished without &quot;Going Online&quot; if one can maintain perfect mental discipline in the face of a system adversarially designed to break your attention and get you to Go Online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: At this point, I apologize if I am repeating text from Cal Newport's thinking on &quot;Digital Minimalism&quot;. I feel that I am implicitly responding to people who <em>have</em> read his book, and I have probably absorbed many of the thoughts through osmosis and I am probably retreading much of the same ground. So, I searched <code>&quot;cal newport&quot; &quot;two phones&quot;</code> and the only results that came up were comments on his blog. Hooray!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some advocates for minimalism wish to replace their phone with purpose-built devices. It conjures up the ludicrous image of someone heaving an overflowing pack. There is no minimalism in replacing one tiny device with the heft of a camera, a flashlight, a noise generator, a watch, a wallet, a level, a notepad, a world atlas, an emergency radio, a walkie talkie, a music player, a magnifying glass, etc. Need I go on? To me, this is clearly maximalist. We can achieve minimalism through technology with a bit of intentionality.</p>
<p>See, the iPhone 16 Pro is not my first smart phone! I have sadly broken every viable Android I've used (one by losing its password, another by trying to replace the battery, and a third by leaving it on the hood of my car during a camping trip.)</p>
<p>But I still own an iPhone 13 Mini which, save for its lack of a telephoto lens and dedicated camera button, I find to be a far more reasonably sized phone than anything on the market. Plus, it still runs iOS 18, which is a far superior experience compared to iOS 26. I have not connected it to the internet since 2024.</p>
<p>So, I maintain a second phone, for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ocean sounds and other background sounds</li>
<li>Clocks: Timers, stopwatches, and alarms</li>
<li>A compass and a level</li>
<li>Flashlight</li>
</ul>
<p>(As a fun bonus, a second phone allows you to have two sources of background sounds, two sources of flashlight, or an off-camera source of light when taking photos, etc.)</p>
<p>In my day to day life, this has already been useful. I often read a book as I time my stretches, and I am reading with the same focus I had in my youth. I can walk along cliffs and throw off rocks and estimate their height using the stopwatch.</p>
<p>While not for the goal of digital minimalism, I have difficulty getting up in the morning, and a second physical alarm is useful for getting me out of bed.</p>
<p>I think I would like to periodically connect this second smartphone to the internet. If I were to connect this to the internet a few times a year, I think I would like to also use this phone for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obsidian, which I use frequently. I would set up a second vault, so as to avoid sync issues.</li>
<li>Maps, which can be used offline.</li>
<li>Photography. It is difficult to get photos <em>off</em> the device by wire, and Halide refuses to work unless I connect online.</li>
<li>Credit cards, which can be used offline, but have to be set up online.</li>
<li>Translations. (Apple has on-device offline translation, but one needs to be online to download the models.)</li>
<li><em>Maybe</em> reading, such as a copy of Wikipedia, or e-books.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discord is already bad</strong>, but now it's going to require IDs and video selfies.</li>
<li><strong>Stoat looks like the best</strong>. I think it is the ship to jump to.
<ul>
<li>Of the alternatives, all of them are either proprietary or use LLM-generated code, and a lot of the proprietary ones seem Evil.</li>
<li>If you are concerned about Stoat having had a few small LLM commits, know that <strong>Stoat is the most anti-AI alternative</strong>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Stoat LLM controversy is blown out of the water, since (1) Stoat has a very rare anti-AI policy, and (2) almost everything else has AI in it now anyways. You are definitely using software with LLM-generated code in it, directly and indirectly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article goes over the criteria for an alternative, why TeamSpeak, Mumble, etc. aren't up to par, and why the &quot;LLM controversy&quot; about Stoat is ill-informed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a few weeks, it will be March, and Discord will require every user to upload their ID or a video-selfie (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out">The Verge</a>), the latter of which will be analyzed using AI, and both of which will be sent to a third party vendor, only months after one of those vendors suffered a data breach. </p>
<p>This is on top of Discord having a <a href="https://lynndotpy.dev/posts/discord-optout-2023/">mandatory arbitration clause and class action waiver</a> which prevents you from being able to sue them in court (and, yes, this works in the United States), and this is on top of Discord scanning all your messages to train its AI models.</p>
<p><strong>Discord has been bad for years and is getting worse, it's time to jump ship</strong>. I've been gaming on The Computer for years, and I've used IRC, Skype, Steam chat, TeamSpeak, Mumble, Ventrilo, and integrated game chats in everything from huge games like RuneScape to tiny long-defunct games like Goomba Online or Halo Crusades. I'm also a cybersecurity person, software engineer, and deep learning researcher who left in 2022 as I started to sour on the industry.</p>
<p>Having had looked at the alternatives, I believe <strong>Stoat is the ship to jump to</strong>. But it <a href="https://github.com/orgs/stoatchat/discussions/1022">is facing some backlash over having had a few small LLM commits</a>, which I believe is disproportionate.</p>
<p>A good alternative should be:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p><strong>User friendly</strong>. It should be easy for someone to start using this software on MacOS, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, or in the web app. This is a minimum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open source</strong>, both so we can jump ship if things turn to shit, but also so we can <em>look at the code</em>. This is increasingly important in an era of vibe-coded. You can <strong>assume anything proprietary is vibe coded</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not vibe coded</strong>. There's a difference between code that was created in part using LLMs, and someone lazily asking a chatbot to change a feature. Lots of bad software is being made by vibe coding, and some of them are crazy people who believe vibe-coding is a way to birth God. That's, uh, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LLM guidelines that emphasize transparency and quality</strong>. As I'll argue later, <em>LLM generated code is everywhere now</em>. There is no way to discern LLM generated code from human generated code, and the only option is to <strong>hold code to a high standard in review</strong>. A contribution policy can never ban LLM generated code, it can only ban people from disclosing when they use LLM generated code. In the interest of quality and transparency, Forgejo's <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/governance/src/branch/main/AIAgreement.md">AI Agreement</a> is a reasonable one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy friendly</strong>. What's <em>far far worse</em> than having LLM generated code is having a privacy policy that <em>sends all your messages to an AI model</em>. You should rather take a privacy-friendly vibe-coded app with code you can inspect, versus something like TeamSpeak, which is proprietary and sends your data to train Grok</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No mandatory arbitration clause</strong>: This is a huge thing. It's increasingly common to include a section in the Terms of Service which requires users to agree <em>never to sue the company</em>. In the United States, these are almost always upheld, even in extreme cases.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p><strong>tldr</strong>: I have very low trust in Microsoft and their products. I am in the market for a GUI code editor to recommend and use in lieu of VS Code. I've used Atom, KATE, Lapce, VS Code, and VS Codium. </p>
<p>At a minimum, I want something that is open source and easy to build. Zed was annoying to build on MacOS because of Xcode, but <strong>Zed was effortless to build on Linux!</strong> This makes me think Zed would be less likely to be able to do a successful rugpull. (Plus, Zed does not have the same market position as Microsoft).</p>
<p>Zed is familiar and good and it's easy to disable all the AI features with one toggle.</p>
<p>As a note: This is one of the things I really love about Rust. The only painful thing about the build was that it took awhile to bake. But I had no debugging steps or effort to do when building Zed (on Linux).</p>

            <p>Whew, 2024 was quite a year. This was a year where I had a surplus of free time. I twiddled away on Blender projects, I picked up photography and guitar, I made a new friend, and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> released, which was maybe the highlight of my year.</p>
<p>But this is a <em>devblog</em>, so, much as I'd love to, this won't be a <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> blogpost.</p>
<p>In my day job, I'm still just doing fullstack dev: Docker, Postgres, C#/.NET, TypeScript, Angular, some Python, and a teensy bit of Go and Rust. It's all proprietary, so I can't tell you more here. Womp womp.</p>
<p>But I got <em>a lot</em> done in 2024. </p>
