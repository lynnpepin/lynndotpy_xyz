<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> In 2014, SSDs were unreliable but cool and new. They've become more reliable over the years, but going into 2024, they're showing a streak of unreliability again. I've had had an SSD fail, an enclosure fail, and an SSD+enclosure which seemed to break eachother.</p>
<p>The worst offenders are SanDisk, Western Digital, Samsung. <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/ssd-edition-2023-mid-year-drive-stats-review/">Backblaze reports</a> roughly confirm this. See <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage/resources/hard-drive-test-data">their full stats page</a> here.</p>
<p>I didn't even know Dell made SSDs, but BackBlaze reports Dell as the lowest failure rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>My first piece of external storage was a 512MB USB 2.0 flash drive, which I made good use of in elementary school.</p>
<p>I made sure to keep backups of everything, everywhere, all the time, until one stressful day in junior year that I lost a 16GB flashdrive. I had hours of homework completed on it, fighting for a competitive GPA-based scholarship where every point mattered. I sobbed having had lost it. My fault for not keeping a copy.</p>
<p>I've fastidiously maintained backups of my backups, ensuring to have no single point of failure (short of a house fire) since then. For these purposes I recommend <a href="https://syncthing.net/">SyncThing</a>, a FOSS tool to sync files between your devices in a peer-to-peer manner.</p>
<p>This paranoid commitment to data integrity finally held up in 2023, the year of <em>atrocious SSDs.</em></p>
<p>I've had the following SSDs and enclosures fail on me in the past year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either the Plugable USB C M.2 NVMe enclosure (B07N48N5GR) or a WD_Black 850 drive.
<ul>
<li>After use, the 850 drive wouldn't respond in any other enclosure, and I wasn't willing to test any drive in the Plugable.</li>
<li>There had been reports that the Plugable enclosure fried drives, so I'm inclined to blame the enclosure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Sabrent Utlra Slim USB 3.0 to 2.5 inch SATA aluminum enclosure (B00LS31KQG), which simply stopped reading disks after one use. The disk is still fine:</li>
<li>The SanDisk 2TB Extreme PRO Portable SSD (B08GV4YYV7), due to problems impacting <em>every single one of these</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, the greatest betrayal was the SanDisk 2TB Extreme Pro. I had my failure in January 2023, and now (December 2023), people are still suffering failures (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/102l844/sandisk_extreme_2tb_vs_samsung_t7_2tb_they_are/j77w8bv/">Reddit Feb 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued">The Verge August 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/sandisk-extreme-pro-failures-are-due-to-design-flaw">TomsHardware Nov 2023</a>), despite Western Digital's insistence that it's been fixed. Everything I put on the SanDisk were files I considered &quot;non-critical&quot;, but I miss them now. Old photos, homeworks, notes, server logs, and project repositories. </p>
<p>Everything lost. And Amazon is still selling them.</p>
<p>Now, looking for a new SSD feels like walking a field of landmines. I can't trust SanDisk, I can't trust Western Digital, I can't trust Samsung (who has reported problems with the 870 Evo and 970 Evo and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23589116/samsung-ssd-990-980-pro-m2-health-failing-defective">the 990 especially, per The Verge</a>), and you can't trust Amazon, which is notoriously full of counterfeits.</p>
<p>SSDs were notoriously unreliable a decade ago, and that was a price people accepted for the performance benefits they offered over HHDs. (It was amazing to watch Windows 7 boot in seconds rather than minutes. In 2014, I was proud of my one-minute Ubuntu boot time!).</p>
<p>BackBlaze, famous for reporting their experienced HDD reliability, <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/ssd-edition-2023-mid-year-drive-stats-review/">has started reporting SSD reliability</a>. Their stats confirm a trend others have observed: SSDs over the past few years have had some <em>bad</em> design flaws and some <em>bad</em> batches.</p>
<p>From what I see, Dell looks like the most reliable SSD manufacturer. I didn't even know Dell made SSDs, but I think I know where I'm going for my next purchase.</p>
