- [ ] stop pretending manpages are good
  - dense, no examples, assumes other knowledge people might not have
  - alphabetical flags useful for reference, not for learning.
    - no culture valuing order of importance
  - less: "opposite of more"
    - "opposite of more" is about as inaccurate as it can get
    - description doesn't explain *what* `less` is, except in relation to `more` and `vi`
    - `man more` gives `file perusal filter for vrt viewing`, but on macos, `more` is aliased to `less`
