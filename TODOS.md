- [ ] stop pretending manpages are good
  - dense, no examples, assumes other knowledge people might not have
  - alphabetical flags useful for reference, not for learning.
    - no culture valuing order of importance
  - less: "opposite of more"
    - "opposite of more" is about as inaccurate as it can get
    - description doesn't explain *what* `less` is, except in relation to `more` and `vi`
    - `man more` gives `file perusal filter for vrt viewing`, but on macos, `more` is aliased to `less`
- [ ] Implementing the Library of Babel
  - Integer index to/from content with invertible injection
    - Choose one that looks random: Bit substitution
  - "X results" for search easy
- [ ] Some Phone Things The Boomers Know And Care About
  - A lot of fellow youngins think of boomers as completely tech illiterate
  - It's unfair to throw away any consideration we have for people just because they dare to reach out to us for help sometimes.
  - Some things "Boomers" (and Gen X) have complained about, despite being obstensibly not tech literate:
    - Lightning when everything is on USB C
    - New iPhones with no bezels or home buttons
    - Loss of CD drives
    - Subscription services
    - Windows 11
- [ ] Programming languages worth learning and why
  - All of these are likely to remain relevant
  - Python:
    - Interpreted and interactive; scripting which can run anywhere
    - Hella tools, "2nd best at everything"
  - Javascript:
    - Never going away
    - Learning pure vanilla JS will serve you no matter what framework-of-the-week is out there
    - Interpreter available on most machines, even locked down ones
    - not That Bad
  - Rust:
    - Fast
    - More widely supported than your typical New Language
    - Tied with WASM and web tech, likely to stay relevant for a long long time
  - C:
    - Still relevant, still written
    - Very close analogy to what's happening on the bare metal
    - If you study DS&A, you should do it through C
