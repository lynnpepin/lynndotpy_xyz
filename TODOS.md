- [ ] stop pretending manpages are good
  - dense, no examples, assumes other knowledge people might not have
  - alphabetical flags useful for reference, not for learning.
    - no culture valuing order of importance
  - less: "opposite of more"
    - "opposite of more" is about as inaccurate as it can get
    - description doesn't explain *what* `less` is, except in relation to `more` and `vi`
    - `man more` gives `file perusal filter for vrt viewing`, but on macos, `more` is aliased to `less`

  - A lot of fellow youngins think of boomers as completely tech illiterate
  - It's unfair to throw away any consideration we have for people just because they dare to reach out to us for help sometimes.
  - Some things "Boomers" (and Gen X) have complained about, despite being obstensibly not tech literate:
    - Lightning when everything is on USB C
    - New iPhones with no bezels or home buttons
    - Loss of CD drives
    - Subscription services
    - Windows 11
